Overview
A Proof of Concept (PoC) system that allows users to search for and book rooms that are added by hosts


Description
Hosts are able to add rooms, which consist of one or more beds (single, double, bunk, king, queen) and a number of facilities such as wifi, free parking. Rooms have a check in by and check out by time and are available to book by joined users 365 days a year. Double and bunk beds can hold 2 people and all other beds hold one person. Any registered user can (optionally) become a host by adding a room. Hosts are able to view a list of their rooms and view any bookings for each room.

Users are able to search for available rooms by location, date, number of guests, (optionally) number of beds and (optionally) room facilities.
Users can join the system and book a room for their desired dates. Bookings can be cancelled but not ammended. Joined users can view a list of their future and past bookings, including cancelled bookings and view details for each booking. Exact addresses of rooms are only provided to the joined user once a booking has been made.
